# Please Note

This was a challenge project on Treehouse. The design was not done by me but supplied by Treehouse for the base of the project.

## Here is what I did

- Inside of App.js
  - Create a Planet component that renders a planet card
  - Create a container componant to hold the cards
    - Loop through each planet and create a card for each one dynamically.
  - Render the Container componant and all planets to the screen.
